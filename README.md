# Netspeak 4 application Java

This is the Java interface of the Netspeak 4 core library.

All Java project which use Netspeak 4 need this library. It contains the Java classes of the Netspeak 4 protobuf messages and a JNI to create to Netspeak instances directly in Java.

(See [`netspeak4-application-cpp`](https://github.com/netspeak/netspeak4-application-cpp) for the protobuf message files.)

This is a library. It does not contain a `main` method.

## Getting started

We use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) as our build system. To build this project run `./gradlew build`. Most Java IDEs support Gradle either directly or via some plugin.
